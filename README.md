# CoDrifter — AI Voice Co-Driver for Assetto Corsa

CoDrifter is a real-time AI voice co-driver for Assetto Corsa. It reads live telemetry from the game, detects driving mistakes before they cost lap time, calls them out via voice in under 300ms, and generates a full AI-powered debrief after every session.

---

## What It Does

You're mid-corner, the car starts to straighten. Before you've even registered it, CoDrifter says:

> *"Wait — let it rotate first."*

That call happens in under 300ms from mistake detection to first audio byte. It feels like a real co-driver is watching.

After the session ends, Claude analyzes the full telemetry log and generates a structured debrief — best and worst sectors, which mistakes occurred most, lap time consistency, and the top 3 actionable improvements.

## Architecture

```
Assetto Corsa (Windows Shared Memory)
            ↓
    telemetry/reader.py        — reads 60+ fields at 60hz, logs every frame to CSV
            ↓
    prediction/features.py     — 30-frame rolling window → 20 engineered features
            ↓
    prediction/model.py        — XGBoost classifier, < 5ms inference per frame
            ↓
    voice/coach.py             — ElevenLabs Flash v2.5, < 300ms end-to-end latency
            ↓
    voice/approach.py          — position-based corner entry/exit callouts
            ↓
    [session ends]
            ↓
    debrief/claude_debrief.py  — Claude Sonnet post-session analysis
```

Everything from telemetry read to voice output runs in under 300ms. API calls and CSV writes are fully threaded — the 60hz main loop never blocks.

## Prediction Model

The core of CoDrifter is an XGBoost classifier that runs on every telemetry frame at 60hz.

**How it works:**

Each frame, `prediction/features.py` takes a 30-frame rolling window (~0.5 seconds of history) and engineers 20 features from it — things like rate of yaw change, wheel slip delta, speed trend, and throttle/steering correlation. These capture the *dynamics* of what the car is doing, not just a single snapshot.

The XGBoost model classifies that feature vector into one of four drift-specific classes:

| Class | What it means |
|---|---|
| `LOSING_ANGLE` | Car is straightening mid-corner — rotation is bleeding out |
| `SPEED_LOSS` | Losing speed without meaningful rear slip — inefficient |
| `SNAP_RISK` | Yaw rate is erratic — car is close to spinning |
| `CLEAN` | No mistake detected |

If the prediction exceeds a configurable confidence threshold (default 90%), a voice callout fires.

**Why 90% confidence?** At lower thresholds the model calls too many borderline frames that aren't actually mistakes. At 90% it only speaks up when it's certain — which keeps the co-driver feeling useful rather than noisy.

**Extended telemetry fields** logged per frame include yaw rate, local velocity (X/Y), wheel slip per corner, tyre temperature per corner, TC active, and ABS active. These give the model genuine insight into rotational dynamics — far more signal than speed/throttle/brake alone. The richer the training data, the more precisely it can distinguish a controlled slide from a genuine mistake.

## Voice Callouts

Two callout systems run in parallel:

**Mistake callouts** — fire when the prediction model exceeds the confidence threshold. Cooldown rules prevent spam: 5 seconds per mistake type, 2 seconds minimum between any callout, suppressed in pit lane or with engine off.

**Corner callouts** — position-based, fired from a mapped corner file. Entry callouts fire ~2 seconds before the corner. Exit callouts fire at the apex/exit point with type-specific advice based on corner classification (tight, medium, hairpin, sweeping, feeder).

13 corners are mapped on Drift Playground 2021 with hotkey-configurable mapping in the Tracks tab.

## Post-Session Debrief

After each session, Claude Sonnet reads a summarized version of the telemetry log — not raw CSV rows, a structured digest — and returns a debrief covering:

- Best and worst sectors
- Most frequent mistake types
- Lap time consistency score
- Top 3 actionable improvements
- Comparison to the previous session

The debrief renders in the app automatically after a session ends if auto-debrief is enabled in Settings.

---

## Desktop App

The PyQt6 desktop app wraps all components with a dark-themed UI:

- **Dashboard** — live speed, gear, RPM, throttle/brake/steering bars, AI prediction badge, lap times, rolling telemetry trace
- **History** — browse past sessions with lap count, best lap, and average lap
- **Debrief** — rendered Claude debrief with per-section cards
- **Tracks** — map corner entry/exit positions with configurable hotkey binds, corner type tagging
- **Settings** — API keys, voice volume, cooldown timings, confidence threshold, callout toggles, model training trigger

## Performance Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Telemetry read rate | 60hz — never drop below 30hz |
| Feature engineering | < 2ms per frame |
| XGBoost inference | < 5ms per frame |
| Voice latency | < 300ms end-to-end |
| Main loop blocking | Never — all I/O and API calls threaded |
| CSV write | Every frame via async background thread |
